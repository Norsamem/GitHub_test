        <h1>I am Norsamem B. Salem</h1> 
        <p>I am a dedicated individual currently pursuing the IT strand in my academic journey, although my true passion lies in the realm of arts especially drawing. It's a form of expression that allows me to escape into my creative world and bring my imagination to life. Additionally, I take great pride in being a trusted and loyal friend to those around me. Building strong, lasting relationships is something I value deeply.</p>
        <p>My journey to where I am now included overcoming challenges, as I successfully passed the Alternative Learning System in Munai, Lanao del Norte. This experience has taught me the importance of determination and perseverance in achieving my goals. Throughout my life, I've consistently upheld the values of being a trusted and loyal friend. These qualities define who I am as a person, and I believe that trust and loyalty are the foundations of meaningful connections.</p>
        <p>While I'm known for being a friendly and approachable person, I do admit to being an overthinker, constantly analyzing situations from multiple angles. It's a trait that helps me make informed decisions but also sometimes leads to overanalyzing simple matters. Another aspect of my personality is that I'm easy to sick, meaning that I'm prone to falling ill easily, so I prioritize self-care and maintaining good health. In essence, I am a multifaceted individual who values friendship, creativity, and personal growth.</p>
